# TheMoonAndNeptune
A 2D C++ Unreal Engine 4.25 demo game that is basically noughts and crosses, but with a moon and neptune. You play as the moon and the computer plays as neptune.

The game uses a pass-through material on the camera to replace the tonemapper, so a sprite is rendered "as is" with no colour correction.

Best played at 1920 x 1080 or 4K (with Windows Display settings Scale and layout set to 200%).

Use Alt-Enter inside the window if it is not already set to full-screen.
